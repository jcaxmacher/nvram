Several months ago, AWS [announced a developer preview of the AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-cdk-developer-preview/)
(a.k.a. CDK).  At AWS re:Invent this year (2018), there was an [excellent talk
entitled "Infrastructure Is Code"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh-kVC2r2AU)
which shared AWS' motivation for creating the CDK and a great demo.  After
watching the talk, going through the [CDK workshop](https://cdkworkshop)
and converting a few complex CloudFormation templates, I want to tell you why I think the CDK is awesome.

It boils down one thing: ergonomics.  Essentially, the efficiency with which you
can design, deploy, maintain and destroy cloud resources.  We make and use tools
to improve our efficiency, and some of the tools provide higher effeciency than
others.  So, what tools do we have at our disposal for improving cloud
management ergonomics?

  - Configuration languages (JSON, YAML, HCL)

It has been said that Amazon Web Services provides ["building
blocks"](https://medium.com/tieto-developers/use-aws-services-as-building-blocks-to-implement-your-enterprise-system-598676a0ee49).
While that's true, the sheer number of block shapes, colors and styles
