One of my goals for 2019 is to grow occupationally through increased confidence.
The way I've chosen to tackle this goal is through intentional, periodic publication of
my thoughts and ideas on this website. By doing this, I hope to achieve better balance
between learning new things (which I love to do), and sharing what I have learned publicly.
This should help increase my confidence as I shed my worries about saying the wrong thing, or
saying it the the wrong way.  Objective (as far as I can tell) external measures have indicated
that I am good at what I do, so the deficiency in confidence is not from lack of skill or experience,
just something inside me that, with practice, can be overcome.

I have also heard it said that writing is thinking turbo-charged, so hopefully I'll get a bit
of a boost there as well.  While I believe some of what I write will be useful to others,
if it's not that will be OK.  I plan to mostly write about the cloud and software, since that is
my primary area of expertise.  At some point, I want to record some podcast episodes as well.
The podcast will also be called "Non-volatile Memory" and will be linked here when I publish that.
If you've read this far about my goals and thoughts, thanks.  I hope you enjoy tackling your desired
challenges this year too!
