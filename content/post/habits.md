I heard there's a new habit-forming drug on the market called blogging.
Funny name for a drug, right?  Anyway, people say that it can help improve
your life (unlike illegal drugs which will likely wreck it).

In what ways can it improve my life, you ask?  Blogging has been linked to
improving the quality of one's communication, clarifying one's thoughts on
a topic and raising one's public profile.  So, I'm giving it a shot.  What
could go wrong?

I don't want to lie to you, dear reader.  This is not my first blog.
The road behind me is littered with cleverly titled (or so I thought) and
sparsely populated blogs.  This time, however, I am committing to posting
at least once a week- a promise writ on the water of the vast and
tempestuous ocean that is the internet.

The word blog used to bother me quite a bit.  At this stage in my life I
have more important things to worry about, so I accept there is no changing
it.  No amount of campaigning to "Make Online Journaling Great Again!" will
remove the word blog from our lexicon.  However, I am going to continue
nursing my desire that the word blogosphere be burned with fire until it
is dead.
