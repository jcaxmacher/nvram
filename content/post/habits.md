It's time I started a blog and actually wrote a few things down, if only to help
clarify my thoughts and better remember the things I learn.  While I hope some
of what I write will be useful to others, if it's not that will be OK.  I plan
to mostly write about the cloud and software.  So, let's give it a shot.  What
could go wrong?

The word blog used to bother me quite a bit.  I was younger and had fewer things
of actual importance to care about.  At this stage in my life "someone is doing
something I find dumb on the internet" is not quite newsworthy, so I accept
there is no changing the term blog.  No amount of campaigning to "Make Online
Journaling Great Again!" will remove the word blog from our lexicon.
However, I am quite happy the term ["blogosphere"](https://xkcd.com/181/) has gone out of fashion.
