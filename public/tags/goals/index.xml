      <description>One of my goals for 2019 is to grow occupationally through increased confidence. The way I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to tackle this goal is through intentional, periodic publication of my thoughts and ideas on this website. By doing this, I hope to achieve better balance between learning new things (which I love to do do), and sharing what I have learned publicly. This should help increase my confidence as I shed my worries about saying the wrong thing, or saying it the the wrong way.</description>
