      <description>I recently setup G Suite (aka Google Apps for Work) as the SAML IdP for my personal AWS account following these instructions. Once it was done, I had a very simple way to log into my AWS console using my existing G Suite credentials.
Now I no longer need to remember my IAM user password (well, it was in a password manager, but it&amp;rsquo;s one less thing) and I get the additional benefit of my G Suite-configured MFA settings.</description>
