      <description>I recently setup G Suite (aka Google Apps for Work) as the SAML IdP for my personal AWS account following these instructions. Once it was done, I had a very simple way to log into my AWS console using my existing G Suite credentials.
Now I no longer need to remember my IAM user password (well, it was in a password manager, but it&amp;rsquo;s one less thing) and I get the additional benefit of my G Suite-configured MFA settings.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time I started a blog and actually wrote a few things down, if only to help clarify my thoughts and better remember the things I learn. While I hope some of what I write will be useful to others, if it&amp;rsquo;s not that will be OK. I plan to mostly write about the cloud and software. So, let&amp;rsquo;s give it a shot. What could go wrong?
The word blog used to bother me quite a bit.</description>
