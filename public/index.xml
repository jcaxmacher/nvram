          <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard there&amp;rsquo;s a new habit-forming drug on the market called blogging.
Funny name for a drug, right?  Anyway, people say that it can help improve
your life (unlike illegal drugs which will likely wreck it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what ways can it improve my life, you ask?  Blogging has been linked to
improving the quality of one&amp;rsquo;s communication, clarifying one&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on
a topic and raising one&amp;rsquo;s public profile.  So, I&amp;rsquo;m giving it a shot.  What
could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lie to you, dear reader.  This is not my first blog.
The road behind me is littered with cleverly titled (or so I thought) and
sparsely populated blogs.  This time, however, I am committing to posting
at least once a week.  A promise writ on the water of the vast and
tempestuous ocean that is the internet; yet one intend to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word blog used to bother me quite a bit.  At this stage in my life I
have more important things to worry about, so I accept there is no changing
it.  No amount of campaigning to &amp;ldquo;Make Online Journaling Great Again!&amp;rdquo; will
remove the word blog from our lexicon.  However, I am going to continue
nursing my desire that the word blogosphere be burned with fire until it
is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
